This is the official code provided by Pengcheng Zhao. The code will be released soon.
## Requirements
* Python 3.5
* Pytorch 0.3.0

  [Of course, you can also try the higher version]
## Datasets
For some reasonsï¼Œhere we only provide the *Voice-Face Dataset*.
### Overview
The Voice_Face dataset is suitable for research in bimodal association of speech and face. It is a dataset that includes large-scale voice segments and face images aligned based on "gender and age" attributes. 

The speech segments are extracted from the "aidatatang_1505zh" dataset and the face images are selected from the "CACD2000" dataset. For the initial data of these two modalities, we cleaned the data and combined the attributes by age group (11-20,21-30,31-40,41-50) and gender (male, female), and finally obtained 48000 voice-face image pairs under 8 attribute combinations. 

Some examples are shown in the Voice_example folder and Face_example folder.

### Download
The Voice_Face dataset is only intended for use by universities and research institutions for non-commercial academic research. If you need it, please send a request to email "stevenzhao1001@gmail.com". Once we receive your email, we will provide you with a link to download the dataset.
